# Team Profile Generator 

## Disclaimer
Please check in the distribution folder for the sample template generated by this application


## Description 
This team profile generator was inspired by the need for managers to structure their team builds so that they can have all their employees information carefully laid out in one place. That is why  I have built the Team Profile Generator, so that with just a bunch of easy to fill out command prompts, they can generate a simple HTML webpage that will display all the vital information of each employee in the team.

## Installation
This Program is installed by downloading the necessary files and folders from the Github repository. Then you must open up the repo folder in your terminal and download all necessary dependencies by inputting the command below

```md
npm install
```

Once all dependencies have been installed you can run the program by entering:

```md
node index.js
```


## Usage

Once you have started the program, you will continue to fill out the prompts to create the manager profile, from there you will be prompted to either add an 'Engineer', 'Intern' or 'Finish your build'. If you choose the first two you will be prompted to make their profiles as well, if you choose the latter it will end the program and generate a HTML with the added employee profiles. You can find this HTML file labeled 'index.html' in your distribution folder.

You can use this app whenever you as a manager embark on a new project and have to build a team of employees. This will help you organize employee information in a clean and organized manner.
